## ✅ What I Practiced

- 🧠 Basic `if` conditions for eligibility and number checks
- 🔁 `if-else` for two-way decisions (even/odd, pass/fail)
- 🧮 `if-elif-else` for multi-level logic (grades, discounts)
- 🔍 Nested conditions for complex checks (leap year)
- 💡 Real-world scenarios like ATM systems and shopping logic
